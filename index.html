mongodb-streams-aws

MongoDB change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes without the complexity and risk of tailing the oplog. Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and immediately react to them. Because change streams use the aggregation framework, applications can also filter for specific changes or transform the notifications at will.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers. 

mongodb-streams-aws opens a change stream against a MongoDB collection and logs the changes to the collection to an AWS Cloud Watch custom log stream.
